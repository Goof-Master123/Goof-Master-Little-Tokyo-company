        <p>Fun Fact about my friends at this company about Ice Cream.<p> 
        </p> My friend Shayne loves ice cream so we gave him mochi ice cream of boba tea and sushi goofball</p>
        <p> For the first time I've met Shayne, he told me that he loves ice cream.</p>
        <p> I handed the mochi ice cream to Shyane and he enjoys it a lot.</p>
        <p> So that's why I've decided to name him the master of the ice cream Shayne</p>
